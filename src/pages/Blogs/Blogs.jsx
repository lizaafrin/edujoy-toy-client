    //     </h4>
    //     <p className="text-white-500 mx-2 lg:mx-5">
    //       React, PropTypes is a library that is used to validate the props of
    //       a component. PropTypes is a built-in feature of React, which
    //       provides a way to specify the type and structure of props that a
    //       component expects to receive. By using PropTypes, developers can
    //       ensure that the components are being used correctly and avoid bugs
    //       caused by incorrect usage of props.
    //       <br />
    //       Here are some common PropTypes validation:
    //       <ul>
    //         <li>PropTypes.string</li>
    //         <li>PropTypes.number</li>
    //         <li>PropTypes.bool</li>

    //       Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
    //       engine. It allows developers to write server-side JavaScript code
    //       that can be executed on the server. Node.js provides a non-blocking
    //       I/O model that allows for fast and scalable server-side
    //       applications. With Node.js, developers can build back-end services,

    //     </h4>
    //     <p className="text-white-500 mx-2 lg:mx-5 pb-16">
    //       In React, a custom hook is a JavaScript function that uses one or
    //       more built-in React hooks to encapsulate a certain piece of logic
    //       and make it reusable across different components. Custom hooks allow
    //       developers to extract and reuse stateful logic from components,
    //       making the code more organized, readable, and maintainable. Custom
    //       hooks allow developers to abstract away complex logic and
    //       functionality from components, reducing the amount of code
    //       duplication and making it easier to maintain the codebase. By
    //       encapsulating common logic in a custom hook, developers can avoid
    //       code duplication and improve the overall code quality. Custom hooks
    //       are prefixed with the word "use" to indicate that they are built on
    //       top of the built-in React hooks. A custom hook can use any of the
    //       built-in React hooks, including useState, useEffect, useContext, and
    //       useRef.

              Access Token:
            </span>{" "}
            An access token is a security credential that is used to authenticate and authorize access to protected resources in an application. It is typically issued by an authentication server (such as OAuth) after successful user authentication. The access token is a string that contains encoded information, including details about the user and their permissions.
            <br />
            The access token is sent with each request to the server that requires authentication. It allows the server to verify the identity of the user and determine whether they have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. Access tokens have an expiration time to ensure security and can be short-lived. <br />
            <span className="font-semibold underline">
              Refresh Token:
            </span>
            A refresh token is another type of security credential that is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. While access tokens are short-lived, refresh tokens have a longer lifespan. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication server without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

          Storing Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens on the Client-side:
            </span> <br />
            
            Both access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client-side to prevent unauthorized access and potential attacks. Here are some common practices for storing these tokens: <br />

            Access Tokens: Access tokens are used in each request to the server, so they need to be easily accessible. It's common to store them in memory (e.g., variable) or in a browser's session storage. These storage mechanisms are cleared when the user closes the browser or the session expires. <br />

            Refresh Tokens: Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan and should be securely stored to prevent unauthorized access. It's recommended to store refresh tokens in a secure HTTP-only cookie. This prevents client-side scripts from accessing the token and protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Additionally, you can set the "secure" flag on the cookie to ensure it is only transmitted over HTTPS.

            2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
          </h4>
          <p className="text-white mx-2 lg:mx-5 lg:text-lg">
            SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that have distinct characteristics and use cases. Here's a comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases:
            <br />
            <br />

            <b className='underline'> Data Model:</b> <br />
            - SQL: SQL databases follow a rigid, predefined schema that enforces a structured and organized format for data storage. They use tables with rows and columns to store data, and relationships between tables are established through foreign keys. <br />
            - NoSQL: NoSQL databases are schema-less, which means they do not have a fixed structure. They can handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. NoSQL databases use various data models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph to store data. <br />

            <b className='underline'> Scability:</b> <br />
            - SQL: SQL databases typically scale vertically, which means increasing the hardware resources of a single server to handle larger workloads. Scaling horizontally, i.e., adding more servers to distribute the load, can be challenging. <br />

            - NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute the data across multiple servers. They can handle large amounts of data and high read/write workloads by adding more nodes to the database cluster. <br />

            <b className='underline'> Flexibility:</b> <br />
            - SQL: SQL databases have a fixed schema, which means the structure of the data must be defined beforehand. Changing the schema often requires altering the tables and migrating the existing data, which can be time-consuming. <br />
            - NoSQL: NoSQL databases offer more flexibility as they don't have a fixed schema. You can store different types of data in the same collection or document without the need for predefined schema changes. <br />

            <b className='underline'> Query languages:</b> <br />
            - SQL: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a declarative way to express complex queries, perform joins, filtering, sorting, and aggregations. <br />
            - NoSQL: NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs depending on the data model. For example, key-value stores often have simple get/put operations, while document databases may use query languages similar to SQL or JSON-based query languages. <br />

            <b className='underline'> Consistency and Transactions:</b> <br />
            - SQL: SQL databases generally provide strong consistency and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. They ensure that transactions are executed in an all-or-nothing manner, maintaining data integrity. <br />
            - NoSQL: NoSQL databases may prioritize other properties like availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency. They often provide eventual consistency, which means data updates may take time to propagate across all nodes in a distributed system. <br />

            <b className='underline'> Use Cases:</b> <br />
            - SQL: SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and structured data, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems. <br />
            - NoSQL: NoSQL databases are suitable for handling large-scale data, rapid development, and flexible schemas. They are often used in scenarios involving real-time analytics, content caching, social media platforms, IoT data storage, and handling unstructured or semi-structured data. <br />

            4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
          </h4>
          <p className="text-white mx-2 lg:mx-5 lg:text-lg pb-16 text-left">
            MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for performing advanced data analysis and transformation operations on MongoDB collections. It allows you to process and analyze large amounts of data within the database and retrieve aggregated results.
            <br />
            The aggregate method in MongoDB is used to perform aggregation operations. It takes an array of pipeline stages as its parameter. Each stage represents a step in the aggregation process, where documents are transformed and combined using various operators and expressions.
            <br />

            Here is a general overview of how the MongoDB aggregation framework works:
            <br />

            <strong className='text-indigo-400'> Match Stage:</strong> The aggregation pipeline typically starts with a matching stage using the $match operator. It allows you to filter documents based on specific criteria, similar to the find operation.
            <br />

            <strong className='text-indigo-400'>Project Stage:</strong> The $project stage is used to reshape the documents in the pipeline. It allows you to include or exclude specific fields, create new fields, rename fields, or perform calculations using expressions.
            <br />

            <strong className='text-indigo-400'>Group Stage:</strong> The $group stage is used to group documents together based on a specific field or set of fields. It enables you to perform various aggregation operations on grouped data, such as calculating the sum, average, minimum, or maximum values.
            <br />

            <strong className='text-indigo-400'>Sort Stage:</strong> The $sort stage is optional but often used to sort the output of the aggregation pipeline based on specific fields.
            <br />

            <strong className='text-indigo-400'>Limit and Skip Stages:</strong> The $limit and $skip stages are also optional and allow you to limit the number of documents in the output or skip a certain number of documents.
            <br />

            <strong className='text-indigo-400'> Other Stages:</strong> MongoDB provides several other stages, including $unwind, $lookup, $facet, and more, which can be used for additional data transformations, joining collections, or performing multiple parallel aggregations.
